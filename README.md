#frederic-client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jimhopp/frederic-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jimhopp/frederic-client)

Eventually, this will be an iOS client for the [frederic app](https://github.com/jimhopp/frederic).

Plus, it's a good way to teach myself iOS programming.
